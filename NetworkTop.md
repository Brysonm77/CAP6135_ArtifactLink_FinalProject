# Network Topology 

 ## The inital idea is to present two different LANs with different configurations to test possible weak points in security. 
 The first LAN will have only the necessary available IPs, testing a more hardens topology. The second LAN will be alloted a /24 notation, or 254 available IP addresses. These are connected via two routers which route each LAN to each other. This is done intentially to emmulate two different environments connected from two different locations. The routers operate on an individual IP scheme and will, ideally, only have 4 devices throughout the process.
